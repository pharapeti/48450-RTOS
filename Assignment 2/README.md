### TODO
1. Better error handling
2. In the case that there is no end_header line, notifying the user that the output.txt will be empty (usability)
3. In the case that there is no content in the input file, notifying the user that there is no content (also exiting early)
4. Need a better way to track rowNumber and setting the size for the shared_memory_buffer
5. THE REPORT

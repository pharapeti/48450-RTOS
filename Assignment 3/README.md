## Overview

Program 1 implements the Shortest Time Remaining First CPU scheduling algorithm. It uses a named pipe to transfer the average turn around and waiting time for processes in the ready queue between threads and then outputs this information into a file.

Program 2 implements the First in First Out (FIFO) page replacement algorithm. It uses a queue and signals to acheieve this.


## TODO: Program 1
1. In the report, talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using the SRTF algorithm for CPU scheduling (provide examples)

## TODO: Program 2
1. In the report, talk about the number of page faults will be >= n - where n is the number of distinct elements in the reference string
2. In the report, talk about how when the frame size is 1, the number of page faults will be equal to the number of elements being passed in (if the numbers do not sequentially repeat).
